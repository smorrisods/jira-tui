# jira-tui 🍁

A developer-first, keyboard-driven **Jira terminal UI** written in Rust
(`ratatui` + `crossterm`) — fast, legible, ADF-native, mouse-friendly, and with a
little bit of soul (there's an animated about panel and a mascot named Jax).

It's the third act of a small trilogy:

1. **`jira-tasks`** — the proof-of-concept that showed LLMs can automate Jira
   through a code-reviewable Markdown → ADF pipeline.
2. **`jira-ds-skill`** — that pipeline packaged as a versioned agent skill.
3. **`jira-tui`** — this: a human-facing, at-a-glance way to browse and (soon)
   update your work without opening the browser.

## Highlights

- **Guided onboarding.** First launch greets you with a welcome screen (and Jax)
  that can collect and verify your Jira credentials, or drop you into demo mode.
- **Always explorable.** Runs against built-in sample data with zero setup, and
  caches your last live "my work" list for instant, offline starts.
- **Sort, filter, and peek.** Sort your work by date/priority/status/key, filter
  by status, and toggle a quick-view panel to peek at the selected issue without
  leaving the list.
- **ADF-native rendering.** Headings, task lists, code blocks, tables, and inline
  marks render as structured terminal text — not flattened Markdown.
- **Edit in place.** Change status with a picker, and edit descriptions either in
  a **built-in Markdown editor** or your external `$EDITOR` — recompiled to ADF
  and previewed before anything is sent to Jira.
- **Git-aware.** Detects your repo and branch and elevates the `DS-123` issue in
  your current branch name.
- **Mouse mode + clipboard.** Optional click-to-open, wheel scroll, and
  drag-to-copy via OSC 52 — with Shift-drag reserved for native terminal
  selection.
- **A bit of soul.** A colour-wave animated ASCII about panel (`a`) and a
  toggleable ambient mascot, **Jax** (`J`), who fishes, naps, and parties. 🦦

## Quick start

```bash
cargo run              # live if credentials exist, else demo (welcome on first run)
cargo run -- --demo    # force the offline sample data
cargo run -- --about   # open straight to the animated about panel
cargo run -- --onboard # re-run the welcome / live setup
cargo run -- --init    # scaffold ~/.config/jira-tui/config.toml, then exit
```

Build a release binary:

```bash
cargo build --release   # ./target/release/jira-tui
```

Offline-only build (no HTTP stack):

```bash
cargo build --no-default-features
```

## First run & onboarding

On first launch (when no config exists yet) jira-tui shows a welcome screen:

- **`s` — Set up live access:** enter your Jira **site**, **email**, and **API
  token**. The token is **masked**, **verified** against Jira (`/myself`), then
  saved to `~/.config/jira-tui/token` with `0600` permissions (never in
  `config.toml`). Non-secret settings are written to `config.toml`.
- **`d` — Continue in demo:** keep browsing the sample data.
- **`w` — Write config:** scaffold a default `config.toml` you can edit by hand.

Re-run it any time with `--onboard`. The non-interactive `--init` just writes the
default config file.

## Live mode

You can also configure credentials without the wizard:

```bash
export JIRA_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="…"          # or ~/.config/jira-tui/token, or a token.txt file
export JIRA_BASE_URL="https://your-org.atlassian.net"   # optional
export JIRA_PROJECT="DS"                                  # optional
```

Non-secret settings live in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jira-tui/config.toml`
(default `~/.config/jira-tui/config.toml`):

```toml
base_url = "https://your-org.atlassian.net"
email = "you@example.com"
project = "DS"
mouse = false   # start with mouse mode on/off
```

Missing or invalid credentials never crash the app — it falls back to the last
cached list, then to demo data.

## The work list

The `my work` panel supports quick triage:

- **`s` / `S`** — cycle the sort field (updated date → priority → status → key)
  and flip the direction. The current mode shows in the panel title.
- **`f`** — cycle a status filter (all → each status → all).
- **`v`** — toggle a full-width **quick-view** panel below the list showing the
  selected issue's full fields (type, status, priority, assignee, reporter,
  epic, components, labels, links) and its complete ADF-rendered description,
  acceptance criteria, and transitions — loaded automatically as you move the
  selection.
- **`Tab`** — move keyboard focus between the list and the quick-view panel
  (its border brightens when focused). With focus on quick view, `↑`/`↓` and
  `PageUp`/`PageDown` scroll its body instead of moving the list selection;
  `Tab` again to hand control back to the list.
- **Mouse wheel** scrolls whichever panel the pointer is over — hover the list
  to move the selection, hover quick view to scroll it — no `Tab` needed.
- **`/`** — open **search / go to issue** (see below).
- **`→` / `⏎`** — open the selected issue; **`esc` / `←` / `⌫`** — go back.

## Search & go to issue

Press **`/`** from Home, the full list, or an open issue to search:

- Type to filter your work list by **key or summary** (case-insensitive
  substring match) — results update as you type.
- Type something that looks like an issue key (`DS-123`) and a **"↵ go to
  DS-123"** row appears at the top — press `⏎` to jump straight to that issue
  via a direct fetch, even if it isn't in your current list or view.
- **`↑`/`↓`** to move between results, **`⏎`** to open the highlighted one,
  **`esc`** to cancel back to where you were.

## Swimlane board

Press **`b`** from Home or the full list to open a terminal Kanban board:

- **Columns** are your workflow statuses (Backlog → To Do → In Progress → In
  Review → Done, plus anything else present), each with a live count.
- **Swimlanes** group cards by parent **Epic** — issues under the same Epic
  share a lane, with a **"No epic"** lane for everything else — so you can see
  at a glance how work is distributed across initiatives, the way Jira's own
  board view groups things by default.
- **`↑`/`↓`** move between cards in the current lane/column, **`←`/`→`** switch
  columns, **`PageUp`/`PageDown`** switch lanes, **`⏎`** opens the highlighted
  card, **`/`** jumps into search, **`esc`**/**`q`** goes back home.
- The whole board scrolls (mouse wheel or the same keys) if it's taller than
  the terminal.

The board reflects your current sort and status filter, so narrowing the list
first (see below) narrows the board too.

## Editing

Inside an issue (`Detail`):

- **`t` — change status:** opens a transition picker; pick a target and it's
  applied (via Jira REST in live mode, locally in demo). The current status is
  marked, and a toast confirms the move.
- **`e` — edit the description:** serialises the issue's ADF to Markdown and
  opens it in a **built-in editor** (`^S` to preview, `esc` to cancel). Prefer
  your own editor? **`E`** opens `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` (falling back to `vi`)
  instead. Either way your Markdown is **recompiled to ADF** and shown as a
  **preview**; press `y` to apply (REST in live mode) or `esc` to cancel —
  nothing is sent to Jira until you confirm.

The Markdown ↔ ADF conversion follows the same mapping rules as the
`jira-ds-skill` pipeline (headings, bullet/ordered/task lists, code blocks, and
inline `code`/**bold**/*italic*/links), so the round trip stays ADF-native.

## Mouse & clipboard

Press **`m`** to toggle mouse mode:

- **Click** a row to open that issue.
- **Wheel** scrolls whatever panel is **under the pointer** — the list, the
  quick-view panel, the issue detail, or the board — regardless of which panel
  currently has keyboard focus (`Tab`). Mouse always follows the cursor;
  keyboard follows focus — they're independent.
- **Drag** to select rows; on release the text is copied to your system clipboard
  via **OSC 52** (works over SSH, no X11/Wayland dependency).
- **Shift-drag** bypasses the app so your terminal's **native selection/copy**
  works as usual.

You can also yank without the mouse: **`y`** copies the selected issue key, **`Y`**
copies its browse URL.

## Layout

```
src/
  domain/   stable models + demo data
  adf/      ADF <-> styled text and ADF <-> Markdown (render, to_markdown, compile)
  jira/     live REST client: read + transitions + description writes (feature: live)
  git/      repo/branch detection + key parsing
  config/   XDG config, settings, token, and issue cache
  infra/    clipboard (OSC 52)
  app/      state, data loading, onboarding, transitions, round-trip edit
  ui/       ratatui screens, theme, welcome (Jax), animated about, toasts
  lib.rs    library surface (so tests can drive the real code)
  main.rs   thin binary: terminal lifecycle, event loop, $EDITOR launch
tests/      cli.rs (process) + render.rs (headless TestBackend)
docs/       product + technical design specs (SPEC, IMPLEMENTATION, …)
```

## Testing

```bash
cargo test        # unit + integration suite
cargo clippy --all-targets
cargo clippy --no-default-features --all-targets   # offline build stays clean
```

The suite covers ADF rendering (including malformed input), branch-key parsing,
config/cache/token lifecycle, selection and mouse logic, the credential form, the
CLI surface (`--version`, `--help`, `--init`), and headless rendering of every
screen via `ratatui`'s `TestBackend`.

## Status

Milestone 1 (browse) and Milestone 2 (quick transitions + the Markdown
round-trip edit) are working end to end against demo, cached, and live data, with
onboarding, mouse mode, clipboard support, sort/filter, a focusable quick-view
panel, search / go-to-issue, and a swimlane board grouped by epic. Attachments
are next — see `docs/` for the full spec and roadmap.

## Guidelines

See `AGENTS.md`. In short: ADF-first, demo mode never breaks, preview before
mutate, Canadian spelling 🍁, and Conventional Commits with Markdown bodies (bold
section labels, no headings).
